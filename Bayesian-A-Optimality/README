--Usage: 

For real-world experiments, run the file:
  >> main_readdata.m

For synthetic experiments, run the file:
  >> main_synthetic.m 
Regarding synthetic experiments, the results may not be exactly 
the same as the paper due to randomness in generating the data. 
However, the overall behavior should agree with the paper. 

The parameters (e.g., #repeated experiments, data correlation) are 
already set up according to description of experiments.
One can look into the files to further change the settings. 
Specifically, to change the data generating process, one can 
configure the file "load_data4opt.m".

--Dataset:

The "housing.mat" is generated from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing",
as described by the paper.
